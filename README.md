Some files of note: 
RUN.py is the automation script used to generate counts of commits/aborts/transactions and timing data. The /usr/bin/time version of the time function was used because it outputs data without outputting to stderr and has a convenient verbose mode which gives other interesting and relevant information about the execution of a program. 

parse.py/parse_swaps.py is used to turn the data generated by RUN.py into csvs using regex. The configurations of these files changed with every run we needed to parse, but the state they are in now gives a good idea of their functioning.
